This plugin adds useful admin links and resources for Gravity Forms to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar.

== Description ==

This small and lightweight plugin just adds a lot Gravity Forms related resources to your toolbar / admin bar. Also links to all admin settings pages pages of the plugin are included, making the life of form administrators/ developers a lot easier. So you might just switch from the fontend of your site to read current 'Entries' or just 'Add a new Form' etc. *How cool is that? :)* Also, support for all official and lots of third-party add-ons is included!

As the name suggests this plugin is primarily intended towards website admins/ developers. Beside the forum, support links etc. the main plugin settings links will only appear if the current user has the appropiate rights/ capabillities for these. This just goes hand in hand with the very same user rights Gravity Forms itself uses to display its menu entries. So also Editors or any user user with the proper rights could view 'Entries' etc (you could easily tweak all those roles & caps with the awesome ["Members" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/)!).

= NEW Features since v1.2 =
* Admin settings page to optinally remove Support/Docs/FAQ and/or "Active Extensions" sections from menu (settings under "General Settings")

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 3.3 and 3.3.1!
It also works great with WP 3.2 - and also should with WP 3.1 - but we only tested extensively with WP 3.3+ this time. So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.

= How are new resources being added to the toolbar / admin bar? =
Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and I'll add the link(s) if it is useful for admins/ webmasters and the Gravity Forms community.

= How could my plugin/extension settings page be added to the admin bar links? =
This is possible of course and highly welcomed! Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and we sort out the details!
Particularly, I need the admin url for the primary options page (like so `wp-admin/admin.php?page=foo`). I also need the correct name of the main PHP class or function (to check if the plugin extension exists or not). (I don't own all the premium stuff myself yet so you're more than welcomed to help me out with these things. Thank you!)

= There are still some other plugins for Gravity Forms out there why aren't these included by default? =
Simple answer: Linking/ adding is only possible where a plugin has its own admin pages and these are properly accessable.
