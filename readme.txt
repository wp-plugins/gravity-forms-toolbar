This plugin adds useful admin links and resources for Gravity Forms to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar.

== Description ==

= Quick Access to Gravity Forms Resources - Time Saver & Helper Tool! =
This **small and lightweight plugin** just adds a lot Gravity Forms related resources to your toolbar / admin bar. Also links to all admin settings pages pages of the plugin are included, making the life of form administrators/ developers a lot easier. So you might just switch from the fontend of your site to read current 'Entries' or just 'Add a new Form' etc. *How cool is that? :)* Also, support for all official and lots of third-party add-ons is included!

= General Features =
* Display notifications when new Gravity Forms plugin update is available.
* Settings to control menu items notifications display for updates and unread entries.
* Toolbar menu item for *Gravity Forms Toolbar* plugin settings.
* Admin settings page to optinally remove *Support/Docs/FAQ*, *Active Extensions* and *Official Add-Ons* sections from menu (settings under "General Settings").
* Admin settings allow also to dynamically add existing *Forms* (link to their edit pages) and *Entries* of these forms.
* Visual notification of new entries in the Toolbar (top level) and on "Entries" sub-level (if dynamic entries are activated).
* A massive list of resource & community links is included: support forums, tutorials, code snippets, translations etc.
* 3 action hooks included for hooking custom menu items in -- for all main sections plus the resource group section ([see FAQ section here for more info on that](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-toolbar/faq/)).
* 8 additional icon colors included :) (changeable via filters)
* 5 filters included to change wording/tooltip and icon of the main item - for more info [see FAQ section here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/gravity-forms-toolbar/faq/)
* Fully internationalized! Real-life tested and developed with international users in mind! Also supports update-secure custom language file (if you need special wording...)
* Fully WPML compatible!
* Tested with WordPress versions 3.2-branch, 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.4-beta releases - also in debug mode (no stuff there, ok? :)

* User Registration
* PayPal
* PayPal Pro
* MailChimp
* AWeber

* *Your free or premium Gravity Forms specific plugin/add-on? - [Just contact me with specific data](http://genesisthemes.de/en/contact/)*

= Special Features =
* Not only supporting official Gravity Forms/ Gravity Help sites ALSO third-party and user links - so just the whole Gravity Forms ecosystem :)
* Link to downloadable German language packs - only displayed when German locales are active (de_DE, de_AT, de_CH, de_LU)
* Link to Dutch language/translation plugin - only displayed when Dutch locales are active (nl_NL or nl)
* *NOTE:* I would be happy to add more language/locale specific resources and more useful third-party links - just contact me!

As the name suggests this plugin is primarily **intended towards website admins/ developers**. Beside the forum, support links etc. the main plugin settings links will only appear if the current user has the appropiate rights/ capabillities for these. This just goes hand in hand with the very same user rights Gravity Forms itself uses to display its menu entries. So also *Editors* or any user with the proper rights could view 'Entries' etc (you could easily tweak all those roles & caps with the awesome ["Members" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/members/)!).

* Serbian by Dev4Press - currently 87% complete
* Lithuanian by Vincent G. - currently 87% complete
* .pot file (`gravity-forms-toolbar.pot`) for translators is also always included :)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `gravity-forms-toolbar` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory -- or just upload the ZIP package via 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' in your WP Admin
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look at your toolbar / admin bar and enjoy using the new Gravity Forms links there :)
4. Adjust a few options on the settings page - under "General Settings > Gravity Forms Toolbar"
5. Go and manage your entries and forms or develop new ones :)

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/gravity-forms-toolbar/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `gravity-forms-toolbar-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with newest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with WordPress 3.3 and 3.3.1!
It also works great with WP 3.2 - and also should with WP 3.1 - but we only tested extensively with WP 3.3+ this time. So you always should run the latest WordPress version for a lot of reasons.

= How are new resources being added to the toolbar / admin bar? =
Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and I'll add the link(s) if it is useful for admins/ webmasters and the Gravity Forms community.

= How could my plugin/extension settings page be added to the admin bar links? =
This is possible of course and highly welcomed! Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and we sort out the details!
Particularly, I need the admin url for the primary options page (like so `wp-admin/admin.php?page=foo`). I also need the correct name of the main PHP class or function (to check if the plugin extension exists or not). (I don't own all the premium stuff myself yet so you're more than welcomed to help me out with these things. Thank you!)

= There are still some other plugins for Gravity Forms out there why aren't these included by default? =
Simple answer: Linking/ adding is only possible where a plugin has its own admin pages and these are properly accessable.

= Can custom menu items be hooked in via theme or other plugins? =
Yes, this is possible since version 1.5 of the plugin! There are 3 action hooks available for hooking custom menu items in -- `gftb_custom_main_items` for the main section, `gftb_custom_extension_items` for the exentensions section plus `gftb_custom_group_items` for the resource group section. Here's an example code:
`
add_action( 'gftb_custom_group_items', 'gftb_custom_additional_group_item' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Custom Resource Group Items
 *
 * @global mixed $wp_admin_bar
 */
function gftb_custom_additional_group_item() {

	global $wp_admin_bar;

	$wp_admin_bar->add_menu( array(
		'parent' => 'ddw-gravityforms-gfgroup',
		'id'     => 'your-unique-item-id',
		'title'  => __( 'Custom Menu Item Name', 'your-textdomain' ),
		'href'   => 'http://deckerweb.de/',
		'meta'   => array( 'title' => __( 'Custom Menu Item Name Tooltip', 'your-textdomain' ) )
	) );
}
`

= Can certain sections be removed? =
Of course, just via plugin options! -- Additionally, you can use some constants - which can come in handy for customizing stuff for clients etc. You can remove the following sections: Official "Add-Ons" (all items) / "Extensions" area (all items) / "Resources link group" at the bottom (all items) / "German language stuff" (all items) / "Dutch language stuff" (all items)

To achieve this add one, some or all of the following constants to your theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove Add-On Items */
define( 'GFTB_ADDONS_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove Extensions Items */
define( 'GFTB_EXTENSIONS_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove Resource Items */
define( 'GFTB_RESOURCES_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove German Language Items */
define( 'GFTB_DE_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove Dutch Language Items */
define( 'GFTB_NL_DISPLAY', FALSE );
`

= Can the the whole toolbar entry be removed, especially for certain users? =
Yes, that's also possible! This could be useful if your site has special user roles/capabilities or other settings that are beyond the default WordPress stuff etc. For example: if you want to disable the display of any "Gravity Forms Toolbar" items for all user roles of "Editor" please use this code:
`
/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove all items for "Editor" user role */
if ( current_user_can( 'editor' ) ) {
	define( 'GFTB_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

To hide only from the user with a user ID of "2":
`
/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove all items for user ID 2 */
if ( 2 == get_current_user_id() ) {
	define( 'GFTB_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

To hide items only in frontend use this code:
`
/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove all items from frontend */
if ( ! is_admin() ) {
	define( 'GFTB_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

In general, use this constant do hide any "Gravity Forms Toolbar" items:
`
/** Gravity Forms Toolbar: Remove all items */
define( 'GFTB_DISPLAY', FALSE );
`


= Available Filters to Customize More Stuff =
All filters are listed with the filter name in bold and the below additional info, helper functions (if available) as well as usage examples.

**gftb_filter_capability_all**

* Default value: `gravityforms_edit_forms` (set by Gravity Forms plugin itself!)
* 6 Predefined helper functions:
 * `__gftb_admin_only` -- returns `'administrator'` role -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_admin_only' );
`
 * `__gftb_role_editor` -- returns `'editor'` role -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_role_editor' );
`
 * `__gftb_cap_manage_options` -- returns `'manage_options'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_cap_manage_options' );
`
 * `__gftb_cap_install_plugins` -- returns `'install_plugins'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_cap_install_plugins' );
`
 * `__gftb_cap_activate_plugins` -- returns `'activate_plugins'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_cap_activate_plugins' );
`
 * `__gftb_cap_edit_theme_options` -- returns `'edit_theme_options'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', '__gftb_cap_edit_theme_options' );
`
* Another example:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_capability_all', 'custom_gftb_capability_all' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Change Main Capability
 */
function custom_gftb_capability_all() {
	return 'switch_themes';
}
`
--> Changes the capability to `switch_themes`

**gftb_filter_main_icon**

* Default value: Gravity Forms logo (favicon) :)
* 10 Predefined helper functions for the 11 included colored icons, returning special colored icon values - the helper function always has this name: `__gftb_colornamehere_icon()` this results in the following filters ready for usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_blue_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_lightgreen_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_lightgrey_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_orange_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_pink_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_red_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_turquoise_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_yellow_icon' );

add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', '__gftb_theme_images_icon' );
`
--> Where the last helper function returns the icon file (`icon-gftb.png`) found in your current theme's/child theme's `/images/` subfolder

* Example for using with current child theme:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon', 'custom_gftb_main_icon' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Change Main Icon
 */
function custom_gftb_main_icon() {
	return get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/images/custom-icon.png';
}
`
--> Uses a custom image from your active child theme's `/images/` folder

--> Recommended dimensions are 16px x 16px

**gftb_filter_main_icon_display**

* Returning the CSS class for the main item icon
* Default value: `icon-gravityforms` (class is: `.icon-gravityforms`)
* 1 Predefined helper function:
 * `__gftb_no_icon_display()` -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon_display', '__gftb_no_icon_display' );
`
--> This way you can REMOVE the icon!

 * Another example:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_icon_display', 'custom_gftb_main_icon_display_class' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Change Main Icon CSS Class
 */
function custom_gftb_main_icon_display_class() {
	return 'your-custom-icon-class';
}
`
--> You then have to define CSS rules in your theme/child theme stylesheet for your own custom class `.your-custom-icon-class`

--> Recommended dimensions are 16px x 16px

**gftb_filter_main_item**

* Default value: "Gravity Forms"
* Example code for your theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_item', 'custom_gftb_main_item' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Change Main Item Name
 */
function custom_gftb_main_item() {
	return __( 'Your custom main item title', 'your-textdomain' );
}
`

**gftb_filter_main_item_tooltip**

* Default value: "Gravity Forms"
* Example code for your theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
add_filter( 'gftb_filter_main_item_tooltip', 'custom_gftb_main_item_tooltip' );
/**
 * Gravity Forms Toolbar: Change Main Item Name's Tooltip
 */
function custom_gftb_main_item_tooltip() {
	return __( 'Your custom main item title tooltip', 'your-textdomain' );
}
`

**Final note:** If you don't like to add your customizations to your theme's/child theme's `functions.php` file you can also add them to a functionality plugin or an mu-plugin. This way you can also use this better for Multisite environments. In general you are then more independent from child theme changes etc.

**Easy plugin translation platform with GlotPress tool:** [**Translate "Gravity Forms Toolbar"...**](http://translate.wpautobahn.com/projects/wordpress-plugins-deckerweb/gravity-forms-toolbar)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating I recommend the awesome ["Codestyling Localization" plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codestyling-localization/) and for validating the ["Poedit Editor"](http://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, Mac and Linux.

== Additional Info ==
**Idea Behind / Philosophy:** Just a little leightweight plugin for all the form developers and managers out there working 
with the incredible Gravity Forms to make their daily admin life a bit easier. I'll try to add more add-on/plugin support if it makes some sense. So stay tuned :).

**Gravity Forms News Planet** I also have started a little news/feed service via "FriendFeed" that you can subscribe to: http://friendfeed.com/gravityforms-news -- Please contact me via my Twitter for new resources (that have an RSS feed and are related to Gravity Forms!)

* Also big thanks to all translators for providing other languages for this plugin!
